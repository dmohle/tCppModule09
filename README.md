Final Project Assignment: Your Choice!
Overview
For your final project, you have the opportunity to choose between two exciting options:

Create a Checkers Game using Lua and C++.
Propose and develop your own custom C++ project on a topic or idea that excites you.
This assignment allows you to demonstrate your skills in programming, problem-solving, and creativity. It’s your chance to showcase what you’ve learned in this course while working on a project that aligns with your interests.

Option 1: Checkers Game in Lua with C++
Project Description
You will create a Checkers game by combining Lua scripting with C++ programming. Lua will handle the game logic, while C++ will manage the GUI and interface components.

Requirements:
Implement game mechanics:
Board initialization with an 8x8 grid.
Rules for valid player moves, including capturing pieces.
Turn-based play for two players.
Win condition: one player captures all the opponent’s pieces.
Use Lua scripting for:
Defining rules for valid moves.
Tracking the game state.
Use C++ for:
Rendering the game board (text-based or graphical interface).
Interfacing with Lua to process game logic.
Include error handling to manage invalid moves and unexpected inputs.
Stretch Goals:
Add a computer opponent using basic AI.
Implement a graphical user interface using a library like SFML or SDL.
Purpose:
This option introduces you to scripting languages (Lua) and how they can integrate with C++ to build flexible, modular programs. It combines logic, creativity, and game design.

Option 2: Build Your Own Project
Project Description
Propose a C++ project of your own design. The topic is up to you, but it must demonstrate your understanding of C++ programming concepts covered in this course.

Project Requirements:
Submit a proposal that includes:
A brief description of your project idea.
The main features and functionality you plan to implement.
A timeline with milestones.
The program must:
Be written in C++.
Utilize at least two advanced programming concepts from this course, such as:
Object-oriented programming.
File I/O.
Data structures (e.g., linked lists, hash maps).
Error handling.
Integration with libraries or APIs.
Include a user interface (text-based or graphical).
Be well-documented with comments and a short user manual.
Examples of Custom Projects:
A personal budgeting application.
A simple multiplayer card game.
A chatbot using the OpenAI API.
A simulation program (e.g., predator-prey simulation).
A custom data visualization tool.
Submission Guidelines
Proposal (for Option 2):
Due by [insert date]. Submit a one-page proposal outlining your project idea, objectives, and timeline.
Final Submission:
Due by [insert date].
Submit your complete source code and any necessary resources.
Include a README file with:
Project description.
Instructions for running the program.
Explanation of how the program meets the requirements.
Assessment Criteria
Your project will be graded on the following criteria:

Functionality (40 points):

Does the program meet all the required features?
Is the program free from major bugs?
Code Quality (30 points):

Is the code well-organized, readable, and adequately commented?
Are advanced programming concepts implemented correctly?
Creativity and Ambition (20 points):

Does the project demonstrate creativity or go beyond the minimum requirements?
Documentation and Presentation (10 points):

Is the README clear and complete?
Is the project presented professionally?
Stretch Goals (Optional)
Earn up to 10 extra credit points for implementing advanced features or exploring topics beyond the scope of this course. For example:

Adding AI to your Checkers game.
Using an advanced C++ library or API.
Creating a fully polished GUI.
Purpose of the Final Project
This project allows you to take ownership of your learning and apply your skills to a topic or challenge that excites you. Whether you build a Checkers game or create a custom project, the goal is to leave this class with a tangible accomplishment you can be proud of.

Get creative, have fun, and make it awesome!
